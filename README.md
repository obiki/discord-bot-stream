# Discord bot base

A starting point to use to create a Discord bot with detailed instructions.

It should also provide a Docker version with instruction on how to use both with and without docker-compose. 

## Stream plan

### Day 1

Try to get some sort of application up and running that answers to "ping".

Possible steps:
- Set up a bot application for Discord and get a [token](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html)
- Add the bot to a [server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links)
- Create a new node app using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

### Day 2

Try to get it more dynamic by using e.g. dotenv and also provide a Docker solution.
